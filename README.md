# GR37-Implementation
The project was a team effort from beginning to end, with each member taking charge to implement visualizations focusing on each of our research questions:
 * **Ali Lamine**: Suncharge 1a and 1b, He created visualizations that analyzed sales data across different countries. His charts helped determine potential markets for increased or decreased sales efforts.  His visualizations, available in our GitHub repository, are not included in this report.
 * **Andrea Maza Le√≥n**: Suncharge 2, She produced visualizations that mapped the efficiency of the supply chain concerning production and delivery times by suppliers. 
 * **Charles Muiruri**: Suncharge 3, He produced visualizations that compared the performance of various plants in terms of customer reach and quarterly sales figures. <br>
 
Throughout the project, all team members regularly met to discuss the development and integration of their visualizations. In the meetings, we had various debates and suggestions, particularly in relation to the implementation part and the creation of interactive and engaging charts.
